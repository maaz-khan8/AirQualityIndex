Feature Pipeline Development

    Fetch raw weather and pollutant data from external APIs like AQICN or OpenWeather
    Compute features from raw data including time-based features (hour, day, month) and derived features like AQI change rate
    Store processed features in Feature Store (Hopsworks)

Historical Data Backfill

    Run feature pipeline for past dates to generate training data
    Create comprehensive dataset for model training and evaluation

Training Pipeline Implementation

    Fetch historical features and targets from Feature Store
    Experiment with various ML models (Random Forest, Ridge Regression, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
    Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics
    Store trained models in Model Registry

Automated CI/CD Pipeline

    Feature pipeline runs every hour automatically
    Training pipeline runs daily for model updates
    Use GitHub Actions, or similar tools
•Web Application Dashboard
    Load models and features from Feature Store
    Compute real-time predictions for next 3 days
    Display interactive dashboard with Streamlit/Gradio and Flask/FastAPI

Advanced Analytics Features

    Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends
    Use SHAP/LIME for feature importance explanations
    Implement alerts for hazardous AQI levels
    Support multiple forecasting models from statistical to deep learning
